**If you're using Windows and want a .exe, go [here](https://github.com/a-pm4/xbox-controller-vibration/releases).**

A simple way to control the vibration motors of your Xbox controller. Can be used for a variety of purposes. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Tested with an Xbox One controller on Windows. Only works via wired connection.

## How to Use

**LT - Increase Intensity (Left Motor)**\
**RT - Increase Intensity (Right Motor)**\
**LB - Decrease Intensity (Left Motor)**\
**RB - Decrease Intensity (Right Motor)**

**Note: Intensity is increased/decreased by 10%. Use the sliders for anything in between.**

**A - Toggle Vibration**\
**X - Set all motors to 10% intensity**

The program features a very simple GUI.
